# Security Notice - Supabase Authentication

## ✅ Enterprise-Grade Security

This application uses **Supabase** for authentication and database management, providing enterprise-grade security out of the box.

### Security Features

1. **Password Security**: Supabase Auth handles password encryption using industry-standard bcrypt hashing with secure salts.

2. **Built-in Security Features**: Supabase provides:
   - Automatic password reset functionality
   - Email confirmation and verification
   - Session management with automatic token refresh
   - Protection against brute force attacks
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - JWT tokens for secure session management

3. **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect data access at the database level.

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Supabase uses PostgreSQL Row Level Security to ensure users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Users can only read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Only admins can create new users  
CREATE POLICY "Admins can create users" ON public.users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Users can update their own profile (excluding role changes)
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON public.users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id AND OLD.role = NEW.role);
```
