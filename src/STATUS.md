## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Critical Loading Issue (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: App was stuck on "Loading preview" indefinitely

**Root Cause**: 
- AuthProvider attempted Supabase connection with placeholder credentials
- Connection request hung/timed out without resolving
- App waited indefinitely for `isLoading` to become `false`

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Added credential validation helper in `/lib/config.ts`
2. Early exit in AuthProvider when credentials are placeholders
3. Added 5-second timeout for connection attempts
4. Improved error handling and user feedback
5. Added warnings in LoginForm when backend not configured

**Result**: App now loads instantly with or without Supabase configured

### Process.env Error (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: "process is not defined" error in browser

**Solution**: 
- Created browser-compatible config system
- Removed Node.js environment dependencies
- Uses `window.ENV` for runtime configuration
