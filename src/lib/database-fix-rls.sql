-- Notre Dame RFID System - RLS Policy Fix
-- This script fixes the infinite recursion issue by temporarily disabling RLS

-- EMERGENCY FIX: Disable Row Level Security temporarily to resolve infinite recursion
-- This is safe for development but should be properly configured for production

-- Drop all existing policies that cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all classrooms" ON classrooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage classrooms" ON classrooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view their schedules" ON schedules;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage schedules" ON schedules;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view their attendance" ON attendance_records;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert attendance records" ON attendance_records;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage attendance records" ON attendance_records;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their notifications" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage notifications" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update their notifications" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view classrooms" ON classrooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage classrooms" ON classrooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view schedules" ON schedules;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage schedules" ON schedules;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view attendance" ON attendance_records;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can manage attendance records" ON attendance_records;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view notifications" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage notifications" ON notifications;

-- Temporarily disable RLS on all tables to fix infinite recursion
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE classrooms DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE schedules DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE attendance_records DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Note: This disables security for development/testing
-- For production, implement proper RLS policies that don't cause recursion

-- Example of safe RLS policies (commented out for now):
/*
-- Enable RLS and create simple policies
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE classrooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE schedules ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE attendance_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Simple policies without recursion
CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON users FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON classrooms FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON schedules FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON attendance_records FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON notifications FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
